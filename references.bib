abstract = {This paper reviews the burgeoning field of data-driven algorithms and their application in solving increasingly complex decision-making, optimization, and control problems within active distribution networks. By summarizing a wide array of use cases, including network reconfiguration and restoration, crew dispatch, Volt-Var control, dispatch of distributed energy resources, and optimal power flow, we underscore the versatility and potential of data-driven approaches to improve active distribution system operations. The categorization of these algorithms into four main groups-mathematical optimization, end-to-end learning, learning-assisted optimization, and physics-informed learning-provides a structured overview of the current state of research in this domain. Additionally, we delve into enhanced algorithmic strategies such as non-centralized methods, robust and stochastic methods, and online learning, which represent significant advancements in addressing the unique challenges of active distribution systems. The discussion extends to the critical role of datasets and test systems in fostering an open and collaborative research environment, essential for the validation and benchmarking of novel data-driven solutions. In conclusion, we outline the primary challenges that must be navigated to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, alongside the opportunities that lie ahead. These insights aim to pave the way for the development of more resilient, efficient, and adaptive active distribution networks, leveraging the full spectrum of data-driven algorithmic innovations.}

    abstract = { One of the main approaches to model reduction of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems is by means of interpolation. Data-driven model reduction constitutes a special case. The Loewner matrix, originally developed for rational interpolation, has been recently extended to the Loewner framework and constitutes a versatile approach to data-driven model reduction. Its main attribute is that it provides a trade-off between accuracy of fit and complexity of the model. Furthermore, constructing models from the given data is quite natural. The purpose of this chapter is to present the fundamentals of the Loewner framework for data-driven reduction of linear systems. }

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has become a key tool for optimizing real-time operations in industrial systems and processes, particularly to enhance performance, safety, and resilience. However, the growing complexity and nonlinearity of modern industrial systems present significant challenges for both first-principles modeling and real-time implementation of typical non-convex optimization associated with conventional MPC designs based on nonlinear models. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of current data-driven predictive control methods that have attributes of being computationally efficient as well as having the distinctive potential to address the above two challenges simultaneously. We focus particularly on two promising frameworks: (1) Koopman-based model predictive control, and (2) data-enabled predictive control, both of which are capable of formulating the optimization problem into a convex form even in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the underlying system. Additionally, we provide an outlook on the potential applications of these methods and briefly discuss their future directions across various industrial sectors.}

abstract = {In this talk we will survey methods for the approximation of large-scale dynamical systems. There are two basic families, namely the SVD-based and Krylov-based approximation methods. The former family is based on the singular value decomposition and the second on moment matching. While the former has many desirable properties including an error bound, it cannot be applied to systems of high complexity. The strength of the latter on the other hand, is that it can be implemented iteratively and is thus appropriate for application to high complexity systems. An effort to combine the best attributes of these two families leads to a third class of approximation methods, which will be referred to as SVD/Krylov. The talk will survey these methods and conclude with a new result concerning model reduction with preservation of passivity which is appropriate for application to large-scale circuits arising in VLSI chip performance verification.}
