abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) offers powerful algorithms to search for optimal controllers of systems with nonlinear, possibly stochastic dynamics that are unknown or highly uncertain. This review mainly covers artificial-intelligence approaches to RL, from the viewpoint of the control engineer. We explain how approximate representations of the solution make RL feasible for problems with continuous states and control actions. Stability is a central concern in control, and we argue that while the control-theoretic RL subfield called adaptive dynamic programming is dedicated to it, stability of RL largely remains an open question. We also cover in detail the case where deep neural networks are used for approximation, leading to the field of deep RL, which has shown great success in recent years. With the control practitioner in mind, we outline opportunities and pitfalls of deep RL; and we close the survey with an outlook that – among other things – points out some avenues for bridging the gap between control and artificial-intelligence RL techniques.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the burgeoning field of data-driven algorithms and their application in solving increasingly complex decision-making, optimization, and control problems within active distribution networks. By summarizing a wide array of use cases, including network reconfiguration and restoration, crew dispatch, Volt-Var control, dispatch of distributed energy resources, and optimal power flow, we underscore the versatility and potential of data-driven approaches to improve active distribution system operations. The categorization of these algorithms into four main groups-mathematical optimization, end-to-end learning, learning-assisted optimization, and physics-informed learning-provides a structured overview of the current state of research in this domain. Additionally, we delve into enhanced algorithmic strategies such as non-centralized methods, robust and stochastic methods, and online learning, which represent significant advancements in addressing the unique challenges of active distribution systems. The discussion extends to the critical role of datasets and test systems in fostering an open and collaborative research environment, essential for the validation and benchmarking of novel data-driven solutions. In conclusion, we outline the primary challenges that must be navigated to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, alongside the opportunities that lie ahead. These insights aim to pave the way for the development of more resilient, efficient, and adaptive active distribution networks, leveraging the full spectrum of data-driven algorithmic innovations.}

    abstract = { One of the main approaches to model reduction of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems is by means of interpolation. Data-driven model reduction constitutes a special case. The Loewner matrix, originally developed for rational interpolation, has been recently extended to the Loewner framework and constitutes a versatile approach to data-driven model reduction. Its main attribute is that it provides a trade-off between accuracy of fit and complexity of the model. Furthermore, constructing models from the given data is quite natural. The purpose of this chapter is to present the fundamentals of the Loewner framework for data-driven reduction of linear systems. }

However, the growing complexity and nonlinearity of modern industrial systems present significant challenges for both first-principles modeling and real-time implementation of typical non-convex optimization associated with conventional MPC designs based on nonlinear models. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of current data-driven predictive control methods that have attributes of being computationally efficient as well as having the distinctive potential to address the above two challenges simultaneously. We focus particularly on two promising frameworks: (1) Koopman-based model predictive control, and (2) data-enabled predictive control, both of which are capable of formulating the optimization problem into a convex form even in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the underlying system. Additionally, we provide an outlook on the potential applications of these methods and briefly discuss their future directions across various industrial sectors.}

abstract = {In this talk we will survey methods for the approximation of large-scale dynamical systems. There are two basic families, namely the SVD-based and Krylov-based approximation methods. The former family is based on the singular value decomposition and the second on moment matching. While the former has many desirable properties including an error bound, it cannot be applied to systems of high complexity. The strength of the latter on the other hand, is that it can be implemented iteratively and is thus appropriate for application to high complexity systems. An effort to combine the best attributes of these two families leads to a third class of approximation methods, which will be referred to as SVD/Krylov. The talk will survey these methods and conclude with a new result concerning model reduction with preservation of passivity which is appropriate for application to large-scale circuits arising in VLSI chip performance verification.}

abstract = {Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a model-order reduction approach, whereby spatial modes of fixed temporal frequencies are extracted from numerical or experimental data sets. The DMD low-rank or reduced operator is typically obtained by singular value decomposition of the temporal data sets. For parameter-dependent models, as found in many multi-query applications such as uncertainty quantification or design optimization, the only parametric DMD technique developed was a stacked approach, with data sets at multiple parameter values were aggregated together, increasing the computational work needed to devise low-rank dynamical reduced-order models. In this paper, we present two novel approach to carry out parametric DMD: one based on the interpolation of the reduced-order DMD eigen-pair and the other based on the interpolation of the reduced DMD (Koopman) operator. Numerical results are presented for diffusion-dominated nonlinear dynamical problems, including a multiphysics radiative transfer example. All three parametric DMD approaches are compared.}

Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

The DDPG controller changes the output power of the storage elements to secure the voltage and frequency stability. This work tested the designed controller for a microgrid that comprises a synchronous generator, two battery energy storage systems and one photovoltaic generator. The controller performance was compared to droop controllers, considering a short-circuit event, feeder and load disconnections. Results showed a consistent reduction of the microgrid’s voltage and frequency deviations with the DDPG algorithm.}

abstract = {We study a class of dynamical systems modelled as Markov chains that admit an invariant distribution via the corresponding transfer, or Koopman, operator. While data-driven algorithms to reconstruct such operators are well known, their relationship with statistical learning is largely unexplored. We formalize a framework to learn the Koopman operator from finite data trajectories of the dynamical system. We consider the restriction of this operator to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and introduce a notion of risk, from which different estimators naturally arise. We link the risk with the estimation of the spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator. These observations motivate a reduced-rank operator regression (RRR) estimator. We derive learning bounds for the proposed estimator, holding both in i.i.d. and non i.i.d. settings, the latter in terms of mixing coefficients. Our results suggest RRR might be beneficial over other widely used estimators as confirmed in numerical experiments both for forecasting and mode decomposition.},

abstract = {Effectively leveraging large, previously collected datasets in reinforcement learning (RL) is a key challenge for large-scale real-world applications. Offline RL algorithms promise to learn effective policies from previously-collected, static datasets without further interaction. However, in practice, offline RL presents a major challenge, and standard off-policy RL methods can fail due to overestimation of values induced by the distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy, especially when training on complex and multi-modal data distributions. In this paper, we propose conservative Q-learning (CQL), which aims to address these limitations by learning a conservative Q-function such that the expected value of a policy under this Q-function lower-bounds its true value. We theoretically show that CQL produces a lower bound on the value of the current policy and that it can be incorporated into a policy learning procedure with theoretical improvement guarantees. In practice, CQL augments the standard Bellman error objective with a simple Q-value regularizer which is straightforward to implement on top of existing deep Q-learning and actor-critic implementations. On both discrete and continuous control domains, we show that CQL substantially outperforms existing offline RL methods, often learning policies that attain 2-5 times higher final return, especially when learning from complex and multi-modal data distributions.},

abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a static logged dataset without continually interacting with the environment. The distribution shift between the learned policy and the behavior policy makes it necessary for the value function to stay conservative such that out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will not be severely overestimated. However, existing approaches, penalizing the unseen actions or regularizing with the behavior policy, are too pessimistic, which suppresses the generalization of the value function and hinders the performance improvement. This paper explores mild but enough conservatism for offline learning while not harming generalization. We propose Mildly Conservative Q-learning (MCQ), where OOD actions are actively trained by assigning them proper pseudo Q values. We theoretically show that MCQ induces a policy that behaves at least as well as the behavior policy and no erroneous overestimation will occur for OOD actions. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that MCQ achieves remarkable performance compared with prior work. Furthermore, MCQ shows superior generalization ability when transferring from offline to online, and significantly outperforms baselines.},

abstract = {The networked microgrid system (NMG) has become an effective alternative for integrating various types of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, because of the increasing share of DERs and high R/X ratio in the system, the uncertainty and variability of DERs' power generation may cause significant voltage violations in the system. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel distributed data-driven voltage control strategy based on data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) to address voltage violations problems in the NMG. The DeePC algorithm uses only historical system trajectories, eliminating the need for parameter identification procedures of power system. Based on the system data model, the proposed controller coordinates MGs in the NMG in a distributed manner by employing a consensus version of the fast alternating direction method of the multiplier algorithm (FADMM), which achieves a better privacy and scalability. Simulation studies in a modified two-MG NMG demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.}
