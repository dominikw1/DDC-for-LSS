The IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf file outlines specific uses of some of the template-specific macros. Unless you want to do some very in-depth typographical tricks, most students can ignore this. However, it does outline some latex usages for general users as well (e.g., equations) which you are encouraged to check out.


For the tex files:
	template.tex
		The the main file for your report, the content of your report goes in here
	coverpage.tex
		A file designing the coverpage. Please change the relevant fields here relating to course title, topic title, your name, etc.
	IEEEtran.cls
		A latex style file used for the template (based on a template from the IEEE) - no changes here are necessary.
		
		
The attached .gz archive outlines the structure your final submission folder should have.
